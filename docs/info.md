## How it works

Pixels are streamed into the chip serially, one channel at a time (R, G, B) over `ui_in`. The `uio_in` pins carry the channel select, pixel_valid flag, frame_done flag, and zone metadata (which third of the face the pixel belongs to).

The chip classifies each pixel for skin tone using RGB thresholds, and accumulates dark pixel counts in the eye, nose, and mouth zones. At end of frame (frame_done pulse), it evaluates all conditions and latches the result onto `uo_out`.

## How to test

Use the MATLAB preprocessing script to convert a BMP image into a pixel stream CSV with zone metadata. Feed pixels via a microcontroller or the cocotb testbench. Pulse `frame_done` after the last pixel. Read `face_detected` on `uo_out[0]`.

## Inputs

| Pin | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| ui_in[7:0] | 8-bit pixel channel value (R, G, or B) |
| uio_in[1:0] | Channel select: 00=R, 01=G, 10=B |
| uio_in[2] | pixel_valid |
| uio_in[3] | frame_done |
| uio_in[5:4] | row_zone: 00=eye, 01=nose, 10=mouth |
| uio_in[7:6] | col_zone: 00=left, 01=right, 10=centre |
